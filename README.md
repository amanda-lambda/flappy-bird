# Flappy Bird

An exercise in recreating Flappy Bird, using PyGame. Aggressively commented for
my own personal benefit as I learn the ins and outs of using PyGame.

## To play
Press the space bar to tell your bird to flap its wings. Every single pipe pair
you pass through gives you an extra point!

## Some extra things I added
- Customizable bird sprite color at the welcome screen [WIP]
- Easy/Medium/Hard level of the games (by adjusting the gaps between the pipes)
